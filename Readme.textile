h1. CSV to XML Parser

This is not a general purpose parser. It is a simple parser designed to convert a specific type
of CSV file to a specific XML format.

h3. Dependencies

This requires Ruby 1.9.x. If you want to use it with early versions of ruby, use the FasterCSV gem and adjust the code as needed.

h3. The CSV format

ChoiceID,Amount,Offer,Bullets
40112_existing,94.97,Digital + 1M + ULD,"NOW, GET MORE\n\n100+ channels of the best shows.\n\nInternet speeds up to 1Mbps.\n\nUnlimited long distance calling."

It expects the Bullets column to include zero or more returns, and converts the paragraphs as follows:

* The first paragraph becomes the headline
* The following paragraphs are checked with a regular expression to place them into a "data", "phone", or "video" bullet. They are also tested for and added to the services node.

h3. Usage

> cd /path_to_project
> ruby offer2xml.rb file_to_parse [optional_save_to_file]

If the optional argument is left off, the file name will be offers.xml and it will be saved in the same directory as the script.

h3. Running Tests

> cd /path_to_project
> ruby test/offer_test.rb

That's it. A very simple utility.
